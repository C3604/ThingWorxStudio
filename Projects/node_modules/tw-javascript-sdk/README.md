This is the JavaScript SDK used for connecting to the platform

### What is this repository for? ###

* An implementation of the Edge SDK in JavaScript

### How do I get set up? ###

To build the code, follow these steps.

  * Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) is installed.  This provides the platform on which the build tooling is run.
  * Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) is installed.  If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```
  npm install -g gulp
  ```

  * From the project folder, execute the following command:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

  * To build the code, you can now run:

  ```
  gulp
  ```

  * You will find the built code under the `dist` folder.
  * To run tests only, run:

  ```
  gulp test
  ```

  * See `gulpfile.js` for other tasks related to the generating of the library.

### Contribution guidelines ###
