### Repo Setup ###

```
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/grunt downloadDeps
```


### Testing ###

Testing is done with a combination of:

- Karma for launching PhantomJS and populating it with the javascript
- Jasmine for executing the tests/providing assertions
- Angular-mock for mocking angular bits

To run the tests use `npm test` or `grunt test` or `karma start`.

Using `karma start` will leave karma running while watching
everything. It will automatically re-run the tests anytime a related
file changes (be it a test, or the actual TML implementation).


### Updating copyright information ###

Several files checked in to git are copyright to other
organizations/people. Thankfully they are all cordoned off into their
own place.

The following command was used in the initial copyright insertion

```
git clean -xfd
node ~/src/thing/copyrightUtil/src/main.js 'src/loader/**/*.js' 'src/vuforia-angular.js'
```
